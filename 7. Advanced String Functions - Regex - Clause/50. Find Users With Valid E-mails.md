1517. Find Users With Valid E-Mails

Table: Users

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| mail          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
user_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains information of the users signed up in a website. Some e-mails are invalid.
 

Write a solution to find the users who have valid emails.

A valid e-mail has a prefix name and a domain where:

The prefix name is a string that may contain letters (upper or lower case), digits, underscore '_', period '.', and/or dash '-'. The prefix name must start with a letter.
The domain is '@leetcode.com'.
Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Users table:
+---------+-----------+-------------------------+
| user_id | name      | mail                    |
+---------+-----------+-------------------------+
| 1       | Winston   | winston@leetcode.com    |
| 2       | Jonathan  | jonathanisgreat         |
| 3       | Annabelle | bella-@leetcode.com     |
| 4       | Sally     | sally.come@leetcode.com |
| 5       | Marwan    | quarz#2020@leetcode.com |
| 6       | David     | david69@gmail.com       |
| 7       | Shapiro   | .shapo@leetcode.com     |
+---------+-----------+-------------------------+
Output: 
+---------+-----------+-------------------------+
| user_id | name      | mail                    |
+---------+-----------+-------------------------+
| 1       | Winston   | winston@leetcode.com    |
| 3       | Annabelle | bella-@leetcode.com     |
| 4       | Sally     | sally.come@leetcode.com |
+---------+-----------+-------------------------+
Explanation: 
The mail of user 2 does not have a domain.
The mail of user 5 has the # sign which is not allowed.
The mail of user 6 does not have the leetcode domain.
The mail of user 7 starts with a period.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT *
FROM Users
WHERE mail REGEXP '^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]*@leetcode\\.com$'

-- SQL QUERY Breakdown
1. Use a regular expression to filter the values (REGEXP)

^ denotes the start of the regular expression
[a-zA-Z] denotes that the prefix has two parts and must start with a letter (can be upper or lower case letter from A-Z)
[a-zA-Z0-9_.-] denotes that the second part of the prefix can be a letter (upper or lower case A-Z), digits 0-9, an underscore, a period, or a dash
* denotes that this can be repeated however many times
@leetcode denotes the domain
\\. denotes that this should actually be a dot 
com denotes the domain
$ denotes the end of a regular expression (standard practice)
