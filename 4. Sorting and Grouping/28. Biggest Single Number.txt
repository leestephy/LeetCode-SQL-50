619. Biggest Single Number

Table: MyNumbers

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| num         | int  |
+-------------+------+
This table may contain duplicates (In other words, there is no primary key for this table in SQL).
Each row of this table contains an integer.
 

A single number is a number that appeared only once in the MyNumbers table.

Find the largest single number. If there is no single number, report null.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
MyNumbers table:
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 1   |
| 4   |
| 5   |
| 6   |
+-----+
Output: 
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 6   |
+-----+
Explanation: The single numbers are 1, 4, 5, and 6.
Since 6 is the largest single number, we return it.
Example 2:

Input: 
MyNumbers table:
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 7   |
| 7   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
+-----+
Output: 
+------+
| num  |
+------+
| null |
+------+
Explanation: There are no single numbers in the input table so we return null.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT MAX(num) AS num 
FROM (
      SELECT num AS num 
      FROM MyNumbers 
      GROUP BY num HAVING COUNT(*)=1
) AS unique_numbers;

% Breakdown of MySQL query statement

Step 1: Inner Subquery
SELECT num AS num 
FROM mynumbers 
GROUP BY num 
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1

- This part of the query groups the num column from the mynumbers table.
- The HAVING COUNT(*) = 1 condition filters out any numbers that appear more than once in the table.
- Essentially, this retrieves only the unique numbers (numbers that appear exactly once) in the table.

Step 2: Outer Query
SELECT MAX(num) AS num 
FROM ( ... ) AS unique_numbers;

- This outer query takes the result of the subquery (the list of unique numbers) and finds the maximum value among them.
- In the above example (2, 5, 8), the MAX(num) function will return 8.

Summary
- The inner query selects numbers that appear exactly once in the mynumbers table.
- The outer query finds the maximum value among those unique numbers.
- The final result is the largest number that appears exactly once in the table.
