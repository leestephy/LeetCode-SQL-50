# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT customer_id
FROM customer
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) =
  (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_key)
   FROM product)

% Breakdown this MySQL query statement

Step 1: Understanding the Inner Subquery
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_key)
FROM product;

- This counts the number of distinct product_key values in the product table.
- It returns a single integer, representing how many unique products exist in the product table.

Step 2: Main Query Breakdown
SELECT customer_id 
FROM customer
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) FROM product);

Breaking it down:
GROUP BY customer_id

- This groups the customer table by customer_id, meaning the next operations will be applied per customer.

COUNT(DISTINCT product_key)

- For each customer_id, this counts the distinct product_key values they have purchased.

HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) FROM product)

- The query filters only those customers who have purchased every unique product available in the product table.
- It ensures that the number of unique products each customer has purchased exactly matches the total number of unique products in the product table.

Summary
- The query finds customers who have purchased every unique product listed in the product table.
- The inner query counts the number of unique products in the product table.
- The outer query groups purchases by customer_id and filters out customers who haven't purchased all unique products.
