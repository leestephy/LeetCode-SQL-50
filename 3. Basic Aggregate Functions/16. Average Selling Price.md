1251. Average Selling Price

Table: Prices

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| product_id    | int     |
| start_date    | date    |
| end_date      | date    |
| price         | int     |

(product_id, start_date, end_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the price of the product_id in the period from start_date to end_date.
For each product_id there will be no two overlapping periods. That means there will be no two intersecting periods for the same product_id.
 
Table: UnitsSold

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| product_id    | int     |
| purchase_date | date    |
| units         | int     |

This table may contain duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates the date, units, and product_id of each product sold. 
 

Write a solution to find the average selling price for each product. average_price should be rounded to 2 decimal places. If a product does not have any sold units, its average selling price is assumed to be 0.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Prices table:

| product_id | start_date | end_date   | price  |
|------------|------------|------------|--------|
| 1          | 2019-02-17 | 2019-02-28 | 5      |
| 1          | 2019-03-01 | 2019-03-22 | 20     |
| 2          | 2019-02-01 | 2019-02-20 | 15     |
| 2          | 2019-02-21 | 2019-03-31 | 30     |

UnitsSold table:

| product_id | purchase_date | units |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| 1          | 2019-02-25    | 100   |
| 1          | 2019-03-01    | 15    |
| 2          | 2019-02-10    | 200   |
| 2          | 2019-03-22    | 30    |

Output: 

| product_id | average_price |
|------------|---------------|
| 1          | 6.96          |
| 2          | 16.96         |

Explanation: 
Average selling price = Total Price of Product / Number of products sold.
Average selling price for product 1 = ((100 * 5) + (15 * 20)) / 115 = 6.96
Average selling price for product 2 = ((200 * 15) + (30 * 30)) / 230 = 16.96

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT p.product_id, IFNULL(ROUND(SUM(units*price)/SUM(units),2),0) AS average_price
FROM Prices p 
LEFT JOIN UnitsSold u
ON p.product_id = u.product_id AND 
u.purchase_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date
GROUP BY product_id
```

%Breaking Down the SQL Query
This query calculates the average price of units sold per product over a specific time period. Let's break it down step by step.

1. SELECT p.product_id
- Retrieves the product_id from the Prices table (p).
- Ensures the results are grouped by product_id.

2. IFNULL(ROUND(SUM(units * price) / SUM(units), 2), 0) AS average_price
- This column computes the average price per unit sold for each product.

Breaking it down further:
- (units * price): Calculates total revenue per row (units multiplied by price).
- SUM(units * price): Sums up the total revenue for each product.
- SUM(units): Sums up the total number of units sold per product.
- SUM(units * price) / SUM(units): Computes the average price per unit by dividing the total revenue by the total units sold.
- ROUND(..., 2): Rounds the result to two decimal places for better readability.
- IFNULL(..., 0): Ensures that if there were no sales (i.e., SUM(units) = 0), the result is 0 instead of NULL.

3. FROM Prices p
- The query starts from the Prices table, aliased as p.
- This table likely contains pricing information for various products.

4. LEFT JOIN UnitsSold u
- Joins the UnitsSold table (u) on matching product_id.
- Left Join ensures that all products in Prices are included, even if they have no sales records in UnitsSold.

5. ON p.product_id = u.product_id
- Matches records between the two tables based on product_id.
- Ensures that only units sold for the corresponding product are used in calculations.

6. AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date
- Filters sales data based on the purchase_date falling within a specified range.
- start_date and end_date need are columns in a related table.

7. GROUP BY product_id
- Groups the results by product so that the calculations (sum and average) are done per product.

Query Execution Steps
1. Filter sales records based on purchase_date falling between start_date and end_date.
2. Join Prices with UnitsSold on product_id.
3. Calculate the total revenue (SUM(units * price)) and total units sold (SUM(units)) per product.
4. Compute the average price per unit sold by dividing total revenue by total units.
5. Round the result to 2 decimal places.
6. Replace NULL values with 0 if there are no units sold.
7. Group the results by product_id to ensure calculations are done per product.

Summary of Query Purpose
✅ Calculates the average price per unit sold per product.
✅ Filters sales data within a date range (start_date to end_date).
✅ Includes all products, even those with no sales, setting average_price = 0 when needed.
✅ Uses ROUND(..., 2) to format prices to two decimal places.
✅ Uses LEFT JOIN to ensure products without sales are still listed.

This query is useful for analyzing product pricing performance over time!
