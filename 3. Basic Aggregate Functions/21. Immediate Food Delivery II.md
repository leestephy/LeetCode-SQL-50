1174. Immediate Food Delivery II

Table: Delivery

| Column Name                 | Type    |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |

delivery_id is the column of unique values of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).
 

If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.

The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.

Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Delivery table:

| delivery_id | customer_id | order_date | customer_pref_delivery_date |
|-------------|-------------|------------|-----------------------------|
| 1           | 1           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 2           | 2           | 2019-08-02 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 3           | 1           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-12                  |
| 4           | 3           | 2019-08-24 | 2019-08-24                  |
| 5           | 3           | 2019-08-21 | 2019-08-22                  |
| 6           | 2           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-13                  |
| 7           | 4           | 2019-08-09 | 2019-08-09                  |

Output: 

| immediate_percentage |
|----------------------|
| 50.00                |

Explanation: 
The customer id 1 has a first order with delivery id 1 and it is scheduled.
The customer id 2 has a first order with delivery id 2 and it is immediate.
The customer id 3 has a first order with delivery id 5 and it is scheduled.
The customer id 4 has a first order with delivery id 7 and it is immediate.
Hence, half the customers have immediate first orders.

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT ROUND(AVG(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date)*100,2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM Delivery
WHERE (customer_id, order_date) IN 
(SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date)
 FROM Delivery
 GROUP BY customer_id)
```

# Breaking down the SQL query
```sql
Step 1: Understanding the Subquery
SELECT customer_id, min(order_date)
FROM Delivery
GROUP BY customer_id

This subquery selects the earliest (MIN(order_date)) order_date for each customer (customer_id).
It groups the data by customer_id, meaning each customer will have only one earliest order date in the result.
The result is a list of (customer_id, earliest order_date) pairs.
```sql
Step 2: Filtering Orders Based on the Subquery
WHERE (customer_id, order_date) IN 
(SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date)
 FROM Delivery
 GROUP BY customer_id)
```
The main query filters the Delivery table and keeps only the first order (earliest order_date) for each customer.
It checks if a (customer_id, order_date) pair matches one of the results from the subquery.
```sql
Step 3: Calculating immediate_percentage
SELECT ROUND(AVG(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date)*100, 2) AS immediate_percentage
```
order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date is a Boolean expression in MySQL:
	It evaluates to 1 (TRUE) if order_date is the same as customer_pref_delivery_date.
	It evaluates to 0 (FALSE) otherwise.

AVG(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) calculates the proportion of first orders where the order date matches the preferred delivery date.

Multiplying by 100 converts it into a percentage.

ROUND(..., 2) rounds the result to two decimal places.

# Final Explanation
- The query calculates the percentage of customers whose first-ever order was delivered on their preferred date.
- It filters out all orders except the first order per customer.
- It then computes how many of these first orders were delivered immediately on the preferred delivery date.
- The result is returned as a percentage rounded to two decimal places.
