550. Game Play Analysis IV

Table: Activity

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.
 

Write a solution to report the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places. 
In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, 
then divide that number by the total number of players.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
Output: 
+-----------+
| fraction  |
+-----------+
| 0.33      |
+-----------+
Explanation: 
Only the player with id 1 logged back in after the first day he had logged in so the answer is 1/3 = 0.33

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT ROUND(SUM(login) / COUNT(DISTINCT player_id),2) AS fraction
FROM (SELECT player_id,
	     DATEDIFF(event_date, min(event_date) OVER (PARTITION BY player_id))=1 AS login
      FROM Activity) AS t

% Breaking down the SQL query
Step 1: Understanding the Inner Query 

SELECT player_id,
       DATEDIFF(event_date, min(event_date) OVER (PARTITION BY player_id))=1 AS login
FROM Activity

This inner query creates a temporary table (t) that calculates whether each player_id logged in exactly one day after their first login.

SELECT player_id, ...

- Selects the player_id column, ensuring we analyze each playerâ€™s activity.

MIN(event_date) OVER (PARTITION BY player_id)
- This window function computes the earliest event date (MIN(event_date)) for each player_id, without grouping the data.
- The PARTITION BY player_id ensures that the first login date is computed separately for each player.

DATEDIFF(event_date, MIN(event_date) OVER (PARTITION BY player_id)) = 1 AS login
- DATEDIFF(event_date, first_login_date) calculates the difference in days between the current login date (event_date) and the player's first login date (MIN(event_date)).
- If this difference equals 1, it means the player logged in exactly on the second day, so we assign login = 1, otherwise, it is 0.

Step 2: Understanding the Outer Query

SELECT ROUND(SUM(login) / COUNT(DISTINCT player_id),2) AS fraction
FROM (SELECT player_id,
	     DATEDIFF(event_date, min(event_date) OVER (PARTITION BY player_id))=1 AS login
      FROM Activity) AS t

SUM(login)
- Adds up all the login values.
- Since login = 1 for players who logged in on the second day and 0 otherwise, this counts how many players logged in on the second day.

COUNT(DISTINCT player_id)
- Counts the total number of unique players.
- This ensures we divide by the number of players, not the number of login attempts.

SUM(login) / COUNT(DISTINCT player_id)
- Computes the fraction of players who logged in exactly one day after their first login.

ROUND(..., 2)
-Rounds the final result to two decimal places.

% Final Summary
Inner Query:
- Identifies each player's first login date.
- Checks if the player logged in exactly one day after their first login (login = 1 if true, 0 otherwise).

Outer Query:
- Calculates the percentage of players whose second login was exactly one day after their first login.
- Uses SUM(login) to count successful second-day logins.
- Uses COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) to count total unique players.
- Rounds the result to two decimal places.
