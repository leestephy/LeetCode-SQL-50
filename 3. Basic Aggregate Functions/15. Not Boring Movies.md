620. Not Boring Movies

Table: Cinema

| Column Name    | Type     |
|----------------|----------|
| id             | int      |
| movie          | varchar  |
| description    | varchar  |
| rating         | float    |
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about the name of a movie, its genre, and its rating.
rating is a 2 decimal places float in the range [0, 10]
 

Write a solution to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not "boring".

Return the result table ordered by rating in descending order.

The result format is in the following example.



Example 1:

Input: 
Cinema table:

| id | movie      | description | rating |
|----|------------|-------------|--------|
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
| 2  | Science    | fiction     | 8.5    |
| 3  | irish      | boring      | 6.2    |
| 4  | Ice song   | Fantacy     | 8.6    |
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |

Output: 

| id | movie      | description | rating |
|----|------------|-------------|--------|
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |

Explanation: 
We have three movies with odd-numbered IDs: 1, 3, and 5. The movie with ID = 3 is boring so we do not include it in the answer.

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT * FROM Cinema
WHERE id % 2 <> 0 AND description != "boring"
ORDER BY rating DESC
```

% Breaking Down the SQL Query
This SQL query retrieves specific records from the Cinema table by applying filtering conditions and sorting them based on ratings.

1. SELECT * FROM Cinema
- SELECT * retrieves all columns from the Cinema table.

2. WHERE id % 2 <> 0 (Filtering Odd-Numbered IDs)
- This condition filters only rows where id is an odd number.
- The modulus operator (%) calculates the remainder when id is divided by 2.
	If id % 2 = 0, the ID is even.
	If id % 2 ≠ 0, the ID is odd.
- This ensures that only movies with odd id values are selected.

3. AND description != "boring" (Filtering Out "Boring" Movies)
- This excludes movies where the description column contains "boring".
- The != operator ensures that only records where description is not equal to "boring" are included.

4. ORDER BY rating DESC (Sorting by Rating in Descending Order)
- Sorts the results by rating, from highest to lowest (DESC = descending).
- Ensures that the highest-rated movies appear at the top.

Query Execution Steps
1. Filter out even-numbered IDs (remove IDs 2 and 4).
2. Exclude rows where description = "boring" (remove id = 1).
3. Sort the remaining rows by rating in descending order.

Summary of Query Purpose
✅ Filters only odd-numbered IDs.
✅ Excludes movies described as "boring".
✅ Sorts the remaining movies by rating in descending order.

This query is useful for selecting and prioritizing high-rated, non-boring movies with odd-numbered IDs.
