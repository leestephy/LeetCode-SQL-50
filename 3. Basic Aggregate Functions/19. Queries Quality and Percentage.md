1211. Queries Quality and Percentage

Table: Queries

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| query_name  | varchar |
| result      | varchar |
| position    | int     |
| rating      | int     |

This table may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
The position column has a value from 1 to 500.
The rating column has a value from 1 to 5. Query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.
 

We define query quality as:

The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.

We also define poor query percentage as:

The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.

Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Queries table:

| query_name | result            | position | rating |
|------------|-------------------|----------|--------|
| Dog        | Golden Retriever  | 1        | 5      |
| Dog        | German Shepherd   | 2        | 5      |
| Dog        | Mule              | 200      | 1      |
| Cat        | Shirazi           | 5        | 2      |
| Cat        | Siamese           | 3        | 3      |
| Cat        | Sphynx            | 7        | 4      |

Output: 

| query_name | quality | poor_query_percentage |
|------------|---------|-----------------------|
| Dog        | 2.50    | 33.33                 |
| Cat        | 0.66    | 33.33                 |

Explanation: 
Dog queries quality is ((5 / 1) + (5 / 2) + (1 / 200)) / 3 = 2.50
Dog queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33

Cat queries quality equals ((2 / 5) + (3 / 3) + (4 / 7)) / 3 = 0.66
Cat queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT query_name, 
ROUND(AVG(rating/position),2) AS quality, 
ROUND(AVG(IF(rating <3,1,0))*100,2) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM Queries
WHERE query_name IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY query_name
```

% Breaking Down the Query

1. SELECT query_name
- Retrieves the query_name column, which groups the results by query name.

2. ROUND(AVG(rating/position),2) AS quality
- (rating / position): This computes a quality score per row by dividing the rating by its position.
- AVG(rating/position): Takes the average quality score for each query_name.
- ROUND(..., 2): Rounds the final result to 2 decimal places.
Purpose: It measures how good a query is based on the rating adjusted by its position in a ranking system.

3. ROUND(AVG(IF(rating < 3, 1, 0)) * 100, 2) AS poor_query_percentage
- IF(rating < 3, 1, 0):If rating is less than 3, return 1 (indicating a poor query). Otherwise, return 0 (indicating a satisfactory query).
- AVG(IF(rating < 3, 1, 0)):Computes the percentage of poor queries by averaging the 1s and 0s.
- * 100: Converts the decimal into a percentage.
- ROUND(..., 2): Rounds to 2 decimal places.
Purpose: This calculates the proportion of queries with low ratings (< 3) for each query name.

4. WHERE query_name IS NOT NULL
- Filters out any rows where query_name is NULL to ensure meaningful grouping.

5. GROUP BY query_name
- Groups the results by each query name so that calculations are performed for each unique query_name.

Summary of Purpose
- Measures the average quality of a query (quality).
- Identifies how many queries have poor ratings (<3) (poor_query_percentage).
- Groups data by query_name for meaningful insights.
This query is useful in evaluating the performance of queries based on ratings and identifying queries with high failure rates.
