1075. Project Employees I

Table: Project

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| project_id  | int     |
| employee_id | int     |

(project_id, employee_id) is the primary key of this table.
employee_id is a foreign key to Employee table.
Each row of this table indicates that the employee with employee_id is working on the project with project_id.
 

Table: Employee

| Column Name      | Type    |
|------------------|---------|
| employee_id      | int     |
| name             | varchar |
| experience_years | int     |

employee_id is the primary key of this table. It's guaranteed that experience_years is not NULL.
Each row of this table contains information about one employee.
 

Write an SQL query that reports the average experience years of all the employees for each project, rounded to 2 digits.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Project table:

| project_id  | employee_id |
|-------------|-------------|
| 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 3           |
| 2           | 1           |
| 2           | 4           |

Employee table:

| employee_id | name   | experience_years |
|-------------|--------|------------------|
| 1           | Khaled | 3                |
| 2           | Ali    | 2                |
| 3           | John   | 1                |
| 4           | Doe    | 2                |

Output: 

| project_id  | average_years |
|-------------|---------------|
| 1           | 2.00          |
| 2           | 2.50          |

Explanation: The average experience years for the first project is (3 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 2.00 and for the second project is (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.50

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT p.project_id, ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years),2) AS average_years
FROM Project p
LEFT JOIN Employee e
ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY p.project_id 
```

% Breaking Down the SQL Query
This query calculates the average experience (in years) of employees working on each project. It does so by joining two tables: Project (p) and Employee (e).

1. SELECT p.project_id
- Retrieves the project_id from the Project table (p).
- Ensures the final output groups data by project.

2. ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years),2) AS average_years
- This calculates the average number of years of experience for employees working on a project.

Breaking it down:
- e.experience_years: This column represents the number of years an employee has worked.
- AVG(e.experience_years): Computes the average experience years across all employees assigned to a project.
- ROUND(..., 2): Rounds the computed average experience to 2 decimal places for better readability.
- Alias (AS average_years): Renames the result column for clarity.

3. FROM Project p
- The query starts from the Project table (p).
- This table likely contains a list of projects and their assigned employees.

4. LEFT JOIN Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
- Joins the Project table (p) with the Employee table (e) based on employee_id.
- Ensures all projects are included, even if no employees are assigned to them (LEFT JOIN).
- If an employee is assigned to multiple projects, they will contribute their experience_years to multiple project groups.

5. GROUP BY p.project_id
- Groups the results by project (project_id).
- Ensures that the AVG(e.experience_years) is calculated separately for each project.

Query Execution Steps
1. Join Project with Employee on employee_id.
2. Group by project_id to calculate the average experience per project.
3. Compute AVG(experience_years) for employees assigned to each project.
4. Round the result to 2 decimal places.
5. Include all projects, even if no employees are assigned (LEFT JOIN).

Summary of Query Purpose
✅ Calculates the average experience of employees assigned to each project.
✅ Uses LEFT JOIN to ensure projects without employees are still included.
✅ Groups by project_id to compute experience per project.
✅ Rounds results to two decimal places for clarity.
✅ Returns NULL for projects without employees, indicating missing data.

This query is useful for assessing the experience level of employees working on different projects!
