1633. Percentage of Users Attended a Contest

Table: Users

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| user_id     | int     |
| user_name   | varchar |

user_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the id of a user.
 

Table: Register

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| contest_id  | int     |
| user_id     | int     |

(contest_id, user_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the id of a user and the contest they registered into.
 

Write a solution to find the percentage of the users registered in each contest rounded to two decimals.

Return the result table ordered by percentage in descending order. In case of a tie, order it by contest_id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Users table:

| user_id | user_name |
|---------|-----------|
| 6       | Alice     |
| 2       | Bob       |
| 7       | Alex      |

Register table:

| contest_id | user_id |
|------------|---------|
| 215        | 6       |
| 209        | 2       |
| 208        | 2       |
| 210        | 6       |
| 208        | 6       |
| 209        | 7       |
| 209        | 6       |
| 215        | 7       |
| 208        | 7       |
| 210        | 2       |
| 207        | 2       |
| 210        | 7       |

Output: 

| contest_id | percentage |
|------------|------------|
| 208        | 100.0      |
| 209        | 100.0      |
| 210        | 100.0      |
| 215        | 66.67      |
| 207        | 33.33      |

Explanation: 
All the users registered in contests 208, 209, and 210. The percentage is 100% and we sort them in the answer table by contest_id in ascending order.
Alice and Alex registered in contest 215 and the percentage is ((2/3) * 100) = 66.67%
Bob registered in contest 207 and the percentage is ((1/3) * 100) = 33.33%

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT contest_id, ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)*100/(SELECT COUNT(user_id) FROM Users),2) AS percentage
FROM Register 
GROUP BY contest_id 
ORDER BY percentage DESC, contest_id
```

% Breaking Down the SQL Query
This SQL query calculates the percentage of unique users who registered for each contest compared to the total number of users in the system. The results are then sorted by the highest percentage and contest_id.

1. SELECT contest_id
- Retrieves the contest_id, which identifies different contests.

2. ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) * 100 / (SELECT COUNT(user_id) FROM Users),2) AS percentage
- This part calculates the percentage of unique users who registered for each contest.

Breaking it down further:
- COUNT(DISTINCT user_id): Counts the number of unique users who registered for a specific contest.
- SELECT COUNT(user_id) FROM Users: Retrieves the total number of users in the Users table. This acts as the denominator for calculating the percentage.
- COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) * 100 / (SELECT COUNT(user_id) FROM Users): Computes the percentage of total users who registered for a given contest.
- ROUND(..., 2): Rounds the result to two decimal places for better readability.
- Alias (AS percentage): Renames the column to percentage.

3. FROM Register
- The data is retrieved from the Register table.
- This table likely tracks user registrations for contests.

4. GROUP BY contest_id
- Groups the results by contest_id, ensuring that the calculations apply per contest.

5. ORDER BY percentage DESC, contest_id
- Sorts the results in descending order (DESC) of percentage
- The contest with the highest percentage of unique users is listed first.
- If two contests have the same percentage, they are sorted by contest_id in ascending order.

Query Execution Steps
1. Count the unique users (DISTINCT user_id) who registered for each contest.
2. Retrieve the total number of users from the Users table.
3. Calculate the percentage of total users who participated in each contest.
4. Round the percentage to 2 decimal places.
5. Group by contest_id to ensure calculations apply to each contest separately.
6. Sort by highest participation percentage first, then by contest_id.

Summary of Query Purpose
✅ Calculates the percentage of unique users who participated in each contest.
✅ Uses COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) to ensure users aren’t double-counted per contest.
✅ Divides by total users from Users to normalize participation.
✅ Uses ROUND(..., 2) for clean numerical formatting.
✅ Sorts by highest participation, ensuring the most popular contests appear first.

This query is useful for analyzing contest participation trends and identifying contests with the most engagement!
