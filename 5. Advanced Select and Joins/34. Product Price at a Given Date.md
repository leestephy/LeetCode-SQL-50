1164. Product Price at a Given Date

Table: Products

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| new_price     | int     |
| change_date   | date    |
+---------------+---------+
(product_id, change_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the price of some product was changed to a new price at some date.
 

Write a solution to find the prices of all products on 2019-08-16. Assume the price of all products before any change is 10.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Products table:
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| product_id | new_price | change_date |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| 1          | 20        | 2019-08-14  |
| 2          | 50        | 2019-08-14  |
| 1          | 30        | 2019-08-15  |
| 1          | 35        | 2019-08-16  |
| 2          | 65        | 2019-08-17  |
| 3          | 20        | 2019-08-18  |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
Output: 
+------------+-------+
| product_id | price |
+------------+-------+
| 2          | 50    |
| 1          | 35    |
| 3          | 10    |

% Query Overview
- This query retrieves the most recent price of each product as of '2019-08-16'. 
- If a product has no price records before or on this date, it assigns a default price of 10.

Step 1: Understanding the Common Table Expression (WITH cte AS (...))
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT *, 
           RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY change_date DESC) AS r
    FROM Products 
    WHERE change_date <= '2019-08-16'
)

Breaking it Down
1. Filters the Products table to include only rows where change_date is on or before '2019-08-16'.
2. Uses RANK() to assign a ranking (r):
	- PARTITION BY product_id: Groups rows by product_id.
	- ORDER BY change_date DESC: Orders rows from newest to oldest within each product_id group.
	- The most recent record for each product_id gets r = 1.

Step 2: Selecting the Most Recent Prices
SELECT product_id, new_price AS price
FROM cte 
WHERE r = 1

Retrieves only the most recent price (r = 1) for each product_id.

Step 3: Handling Missing Products (UNION Clause)
SELECT product_id, 10 AS price
FROM Products
WHERE product_id NOT IN (
    SELECT product_id
    FROM cte
)

- Finds products that do not exist in cte (i.e., they have no price records before '2019-08-16').
- Assigns them a default price of 10.

Example Product Not Found in cte
- Product 3 was filtered out because its only price change was on 2019-09-01 (after 2019-08-16).
- Since it's not in cte, it is assigned a default price of 10.

Step 4: Merging the Results (UNION)
SELECT product_id, new_price AS price FROM cte WHERE r = 1
UNION
SELECT product_id, 10 AS price FROM Products WHERE product_id NOT IN (SELECT product_id FROM cte)

- Combines the valid price records (cte result) with the missing product entries (default price 10).

Step 1: Extracts latest price changes before '2019-08-16' using RANK().
Step 2: Selects only the most recent price (r = 1) for each product.
Step 3: Finds products with no price records before '2019-08-16' and assigns them a default price of 10.
Step 4: Combines both results using UNION.

✅ Use Case:
This query helps track the most recent prices of products as of a specific date, while ensuring products without historical prices are assigned a default value.
%% Optimized SQL Query %%
SELECT product_id, price
FROM (
    -- Get the most recent price for each product before or on '2019-08-16'
    SELECT product_id, new_price AS price
    FROM (
        SELECT product_id, new_price, change_date, 
               ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY change_date DESC) AS r
        FROM Products 
        WHERE change_date <= '2019-08-16'
    ) AS ranked
    WHERE r = 1
) AS latest_prices

UNION

-- Assign default price of 10 for products with no prior price record
SELECT p.product_id, 10 AS price
FROM Products p
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT product_id
    FROM Products
    WHERE change_date <= '2019-08-16'
) AS existing_prices
ON p.product_id = existing_prices.product_id
WHERE existing_prices.product_id IS NULL;

Optimizations Explained
1. Using ROW_NUMBER() Instead of RANK()
	- ROW_NUMBER() ensures exactly one latest record per product_id.
	- RANK() allows duplicates if multiple records have the same date, which we don't need here.
2. Replacing NOT IN with LEFT JOIN
	- LEFT JOIN is faster than NOT IN for larger datasets.
	- The existing_prices subquery ensures we efficiently find products with no prices before '2019-08-16'.
3. Avoiding CTE (WITH cte AS (...))
	- MySQL before version 8.0 does not optimize CTEs well.
	- Instead, using a subquery directly improves performance.
Performance Gains
✅ Faster Execution: Using LEFT JOIN instead of NOT IN
✅ Ensures Unique Selection: Using ROW_NUMBER() instead of RANK()
✅ MySQL-Compatible: Avoids unnecessary WITH CTE
