### **Breaking Down the SQL Query and the CTE Setup**
This query is designed to **retrieve the latest price for each product before or on `2019-08-16`**, and if no price is found before that date, it assigns a **default price of `10`**.

---

## **Step 1: Understanding the CTE (`WITH cte AS (...)`)**
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT *, 
           RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY change_date DESC) AS r
    FROM Products 
    WHERE change_date <= '2019-08-16'
)
```
### **What This CTE Does:**
1. **Filters** the `Products` table to only include records where `change_date <= '2019-08-16'`.  
   - This ensures we only consider price changes **before or on August 16, 2019**.
  
2. **Uses the `RANK()` window function** to rank price changes for each `product_id`.  
   - `PARTITION BY product_id`: Groups rows by `product_id`, meaning ranking resets for each product.  
   - `ORDER BY change_date DESC`: Assigns rank based on the most **recent price first** (i.e., latest `change_date` gets rank `1`).

### **Example: `Products` Table Before Filtering**
| product_id | new_price | change_date |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 1          | 100      | 2019-08-10 |
| 1          | 90       | 2019-07-01 |
| 2          | 200      | 2019-08-15 |
| 2          | 195      | 2019-08-05 |
| 3          | 300      | 2019-09-01 | ❌ (Filtered Out)
| 4          | 400      | 2019-07-20 |

### **After Applying `RANK()` and Filtering (`cte` Output)**
| product_id | new_price | change_date | r |
|------------|----------|------------|---|
| 1          | 100      | 2019-08-10 | 1 |
| 1          | 90       | 2019-07-01 | 2 |
| 2          | 200      | 2019-08-15 | 1 |
| 2          | 195      | 2019-08-05 | 2 |
| 4          | 400      | 2019-07-20 | 1 |

✅ **Why use a CTE here?**
- The **ranking logic is clearly separated**, making the query easier to read.
- The **latest price per product is precomputed**, reducing redundant calculations.
- Helps **avoid unnecessary joins and subqueries**, improving performance.

---

## **Step 2: Selecting the Latest Price for Each Product**
```sql
SELECT product_id, new_price AS price
FROM cte 
WHERE r = 1
```
- This retrieves only rows where `r = 1`, meaning **only the most recent price** for each product before `'2019-08-16'`.

### **Output After This Step**
| product_id | price |
|------------|------|
| 1          | 100  |
| 2          | 200  |
| 4          | 400  |

---

## **Step 3: Handling Products with No Prior Price Records (`UNION`)**
```sql
SELECT product_id, 10 AS price
FROM Products
WHERE product_id NOT IN (
    SELECT product_id
    FROM cte
)
```
### **What This Does:**
- Finds products that **do not exist in the `cte` (i.e., no price changes before `'2019-08-16'`)**.
- Assigns them a **default price of `10`**.

### **Example: `Products` Table Before Checking Missing Products**
| product_id | new_price | change_date |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 1          | 100      | 2019-08-10 |
| 1          | 90       | 2019-07-01 |
| 2          | 200      | 2019-08-15 |
| 2          | 195      | 2019-08-05 |
| 3          | 300      | 2019-09-01 | ❌ (Filtered Out)
| 4          | 400      | 2019-07-20 |

### **Identifying Missing Products**
From `cte`, we have records for **products 1, 2, and 4**, but **product 3 is missing** (since its only price record was after `2019-08-16`).

✅ **Solution:**  
- Assign **`price = 10`** to `product_id = 3`.

### **Output After This Step**
| product_id | price |
|------------|------|
| 3          | 10   |

---

## **Step 4: Combining Results with `UNION`**
```sql
SELECT product_id, new_price AS price FROM cte WHERE r = 1
UNION
SELECT product_id, 10 AS price FROM Products WHERE product_id NOT IN (SELECT product_id FROM cte);
```
- **First part:** Retrieves the **latest valid price per product**.
- **Second part:** Assigns a **default price of `10`** for missing products.
- `UNION` ensures the final result **includes all products** without duplicates.

### **Final Output**
| product_id | price |
|------------|------|
| 1          | 100  |
| 2          | 200  |
| 4          | 400  |
| 3          | 10   |

---

## **Final Summary**
1. **Step 1: Compute the latest price before `'2019-08-16'`**
   - Use a **CTE with `RANK()`** to **rank price changes per product**.
   - **Keep only the most recent price** (`r = 1`).

2. **Step 2: Retrieve the latest price for each product**
   - Extract the **most recent price per product** from the `cte`.

3. **Step 3: Assign a default price for missing products**
   - Find products **not in `cte`** and set `price = 10`.

4. **Step 4: Combine results using `UNION`**
   - Ensures all products are **accounted for**.

---

## **Why Use a CTE Here?**
✅ **Better Readability:**  
- Instead of a complex **nested subquery**, the CTE cleanly separates the **ranking logic** from the final selection.

✅ **Avoids Redundant Computations:**  
- The CTE **precomputes rankings**, so we don't have to **repeat ranking logic** in multiple places.

✅ **Improves Maintainability:**  
- If we need to modify the **ranking method** (e.g., use `ROW_NUMBER()` instead of `RANK()`), we only change the CTE.

✅ **Easier Debugging:**  
- You can **test the CTE separately** (`SELECT * FROM cte`) without affecting the entire query.
