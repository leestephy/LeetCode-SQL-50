610. Triangle Judgement

Table: Triangle

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| x           | int  |
| y           | int  |
| z           | int  |
+-------------+------+
In SQL, (x, y, z) is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains the lengths of three line segments.
 

Report for every three line segments whether they can form a triangle.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Triangle table:
+----+----+----+
| x  | y  | z  |
+----+----+----+
| 13 | 15 | 30 |
| 10 | 20 | 15 |
+----+----+----+
Output: 
+----+----+----+----------+
| x  | y  | z  | triangle |
+----+----+----+----------+
| 13 | 15 | 30 | No       |
| 10 | 20 | 15 | Yes      |
+----+----+----+----------+

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT *, IF(x + y > z AND x + z > y AND y + z > x, 'Yes', 'No') AS triangle 
FROM Triangle

% Breaking down the MySQL query statement
Step 1: Understanding the Triangle Table
This query is selecting data from a table called Triangle, which contains three columns:
x
y
z
- Each row represents three values that may or may not form a valid triangle.

Step 2: Selecting All Columns with SELECT *
SELECT * 

- This part selects all columns (x, y, z, etc.) from the Triangle table.

Step 3: Applying the IF() Condition
IF(x + y > z AND x + z > y AND y + z > x, 'Yes', 'No') AS triangle

- IF(condition, 'Yes', 'No') is a MySQL conditional function that evaluates a boolean expression:
	If the condition is TRUE, it returns 'Yes'
	If the condition is FALSE, it returns 'No'

Step 4: Understanding the Triangle Inequality Theorem
The condition inside IF() checks if three given sides (x, y, z) form a valid triangle using the Triangle Inequality Theorem, which states:

A set of three sides forms a valid triangle if and only if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side:
x + y > z
x + z > y
y + z > x

- If all three conditions are met, the query returns 'Yes' (meaning the values form a valid triangle).
- Otherwise, it returns 'No'.

Step 5: Final Output
The result set includes:
- All original columns from the Triangle table (x, y, z).
- A new column (triangle) that shows 'Yes' if the three sides form a valid triangle, or 'No' otherwise.

Summary
1. Extracts all columns from the Triangle table.
2. Checks if each row satisfies the Triangle Inequality Theorem:
	If valid, marks as Yes.
	Otherwise, marks as No.
3. Returns a new column triangle to indicate if the sides form a valid triangle.
- This query is useful for validating triangle data and can be extended for classification (e.g., equilateral, isosceles, scalene). 

% Extended SQL Query for Triangle Classification
SELECT *, 
       IF(x + y > z AND x + z > y AND y + z > x, 'Yes', 'No') AS is_valid_triangle,
       CASE 
           WHEN x = y AND y = z THEN 'Equilateral'
           WHEN x = y OR y = z OR x = z THEN 'Isosceles'
           ELSE 'Scalene'
       END AS triangle_type,
       IF(x*x + y*y = z*z OR x*x + z*z = y*y OR y*y + z*z = x*x, 'Yes', 'No') AS is_right_triangle
FROM Triangle;

Classification of Triangles
1. Valid Triangle Condition – Check if it satisfies the Triangle Inequality Theorem.
2. Types of Triangles by Side Lengths:
	Equilateral Triangle: All three sides are equal → x = y AND y = z
	Isosceles Triangle: Exactly two sides are equal → (x = y OR y = z OR x = z)
	Scalene Triangle: All three sides are different → x ≠ y AND y ≠ z AND x ≠ z
3. Right Triangle Check (Pythagorean Theorem) – If it satisfies a² + b² = c² for any side, it's a right triangle.
