1789. Primary Department for Each Employee

Table: Employee

| Column Name   |  Type   |
|---------------|---------|
| employee_id   | int     |
| department_id | int     |
| primary_flag  | varchar |

(employee_id, department_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
employee_id is the id of the employee.
department_id is the id of the department to which the employee belongs.
primary_flag is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N'). If the flag is 'Y', the department is the primary department for the employee. If the flag is 'N', the department is not the primary.
 

Employees can belong to multiple departments. When the employee joins other departments, they need to decide which department is their primary department. Note that when an employee belongs to only one department, their primary column is 'N'.

Write a solution to report all the employees with their primary department. For employees who belong to one department, report their only department.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
| employee_id | department_id | primary_flag |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| 1           | 1             | N            |
| 2           | 1             | Y            |
| 2           | 2             | N            |
| 3           | 3             | N            |
| 4           | 2             | N            |
| 4           | 3             | Y            |
| 4           | 4             | N            |

Output: 
| employee_id | department_id |
|-------------|---------------|
| 1           | 1             |
| 2           | 1             |
| 3           | 3             |
| 4           | 3             |

Explanation: 
- The Primary department for employee 1 is 1.
- The Primary department for employee 2 is 1.
- The Primary department for employee 3 is 3.
- The Primary department for employee 4 is 3.

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
(SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee 
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y')
UNION
(SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee  
GROUP BY employee_id
HAVING COUNT(employee_id) = 1
)
ORDER BY employee_id
```
 
% Breaking down the MySQL query statement
Step 1: Understanding the First SELECT Statement
```sql
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee 
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y'
```

- This selects employees where primary_flag = 'Y', meaning only employees who are explicitly marked as "primary" are included.
- Result: Returns (employee_id, department_id) only for those employees whose primary_flag is 'Y'.

Step 2: Understanding the Second SELECT Statement
```sql
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee  
GROUP BY employee_id
HAVING COUNT(employee_id) = 1
```

- Groups by employee_id, meaning each employee is grouped together.
- Uses HAVING COUNT(employee_id) = 1 to filter out employees who appear multiple times in the table.
- This effectively selects employees who belong to only one department (i.e., employees who are not listed in multiple rows).

Step 3: Combining Results with UNION
```sql
(SELECT employee_id, department_id
 FROM Employee 
 WHERE primary_flag = 'Y')
UNION
(SELECT employee_id, department_id
 FROM Employee  
 GROUP BY employee_id
 HAVING COUNT(employee_id) = 1)
```

The UNION operator removes duplicates and merges results from both queries.
It ensures:
1. Employees marked as primary_flag = 'Y' are included.
2. Employees who belong to only one department are included.
3. If an employee appears in both queries, they are included only once due to UNION.

Step 4: Applying ORDER BY employee_id
```sql
ORDER BY employee_id;
```

- This sorts the final result by employee_id in ascending order.

Summary of What This Query Does
First SELECT statement: Retrieves employees explicitly marked as primary.
Second SELECT statement: Retrieves employees who belong to only one department.
UNION: Merges results and removes duplicates.
ORDER BY employee_id: Sorts the final output.

Use Case
This query is useful when: 
✅ You want to retrieve primary employees explicitly marked as primary_flag = 'Y'.
✅ You also want to include employees assigned to only one department.
✅ You want to remove duplicates and ensure the list is sorted.
