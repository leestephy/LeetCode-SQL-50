### **Breaking Down the Line:**
```sql
RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY change_date DESC) AS r
```
This line is part of a **window function** that assigns a **rank** (`r`) to rows **within each `product_id` group**, based on the **latest (`change_date DESC`) price change**.

---

## **1. Understanding `RANK()`**
`RANK()` is a **window function** that assigns a **ranking number** to rows **within a partition (group)** based on the given `ORDER BY` condition.

- **If two or more rows have the same `ORDER BY` value**, they get the **same rank**.
- **The next rank is skipped** (i.e., it does not assign consecutive numbers).

### **Example of `RANK()` Behavior**
| product_id | new_price | change_date | Rank (r) |
|------------|----------|------------|---------|
| 1          | 100      | 2019-08-10 | 1       |
| 1          | 90       | 2019-07-01 | 2       |
| 2          | 200      | 2019-08-15 | 1       |
| 2          | 195      | 2019-08-15 | 1       |
| 2          | 180      | 2019-08-05 | 3       |

**Why does product `2` have two rows ranked `1`?**
- Because `change_date = 2019-08-15` appears **twice**, and `RANK()` assigns **the same rank**.
- The next rank **skips `2`** and assigns `3` to the next record.

---

## **2. `OVER(...)`: Applying the Window Function**
```sql
OVER(PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY change_date DESC)
```
### **How it Works:**
- **`PARTITION BY product_id`**  
  - **Divides the data into separate groups for each `product_id`**.
  - Each `product_id` is treated as a separate dataset.

- **`ORDER BY change_date DESC`**  
  - **Sorts each `product_id`'s rows by `change_date` in descending order** (latest date first).
  - Ensures the most recent price change gets **rank `1`**.

### **Example: How `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY` Work Together**
Consider this `Products` table:

| product_id | new_price | change_date |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 1          | 100      | 2019-08-10 |
| 1          | 90       | 2019-07-01 |
| 2          | 200      | 2019-08-15 |
| 2          | 195      | 2019-08-15 |
| 2          | 180      | 2019-08-05 |
| 3          | 300      | 2019-09-01 |

After applying `RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY change_date DESC) AS r`, we get:

| product_id | new_price | change_date | Rank (r) |
|------------|----------|------------|---------|
| 1          | 100      | 2019-08-10 | 1       |
| 1          | 90       | 2019-07-01 | 2       |
| 2          | 200      | 2019-08-15 | 1       |
| 2          | 195      | 2019-08-15 | 1       |
| 2          | 180      | 2019-08-05 | 3       |
| 3          | 300      | 2019-09-01 | 1       |

âœ… **Key Observations:**
- Each **`product_id`** has its **own ranking sequence**.
- `RANK()` assigns **the same rank to duplicate dates** (`2` got two `1`s).
- The next rank **skips a number** (jumps from `1` â†’ `3` for product `2`).

---

## **3. Why Is This Used?**
This ranking technique is **useful** for:
âœ… **Finding the most recent price per product** (`r = 1`).  
âœ… **Handling ties (same `change_date`)** where multiple records might have the same ranking.  
âœ… **Allowing further filtering in the outer query** (`WHERE r = 1`).  

---

## **4. Alternative: Using `ROW_NUMBER()` Instead**
If we always want a **single row per product**, we could use `ROW_NUMBER()` instead:

```sql
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY change_date DESC) AS r
```

### **Difference Between `RANK()` and `ROW_NUMBER()`**
| Function    | Handles Ties? | Skips Numbers? | Use Case |
|------------|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| **RANK()**        | Yes (assigns same rank) | Yes (jumps in ranking) | If ties should be **ranked the same** |
| **ROW_NUMBER()**  | No (assigns unique ranks) | No (consecutive numbers) | If only **one row per product** is needed |

âœ… If **only one latest record per product** is needed, `ROW_NUMBER()` might be **better** than `RANK()`.

---

## **Final Summary**
```sql
RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY change_date DESC) AS r
```
âœ” **Ranks price changes per `product_id`, from newest (`r = 1`) to oldest.**  
âœ” **Handles duplicate `change_date`s by assigning the same rank, skipping numbers when ties occur.**  
âœ” **Helps in selecting the most recent price before a given date (`r = 1`).**
