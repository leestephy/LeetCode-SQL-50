626. Exchange Seats

Table: Seat

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| student     | varchar |
id is the primary key (unique value) column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of a student.
The ID sequence always starts from 1 and increments continuously.
 

Write a solution to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.

Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Seat table:
| id | student |
|----|---------|
| 1  | Abbot   |
| 2  | Doris   |
| 3  | Emerson |
| 4  | Green   |
| 5  | Jeames  |
Output: 
| id | student |
|----|---------|
| 1  | Doris   |
| 2  | Abbot   |
| 3  | Green   |
| 4  | Emerson |
| 5  | Jeames  |
Explanation: 
Note that if the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT IF(id < (SELECT MAX(id) FROM seat), 
          IF(id % 2 = 0, id - 1, id + 1), 
          IF(id % 2 = 0, id - 1, id)) AS id, 
       student
FROM seat
ORDER BY id;
```

-- Query Breakdown
Understanding the Problem:
• The seat table consists of id (seat number) and student (student sitting in that seat).
• The goal of this query is to swap students in adjacent seats (id values) except for the last seat in an odd-numbered list.
• If id is even, swap with the previous seat (id - 1).
• If id is odd, swap with the next seat (id + 1).
• If id is the last one (highest id and odd), it remains unchanged.

---Breaking Down the Query Logic:
1. Outer SELECT Clause:
   ```sql
   SELECT IF(id < (SELECT MAX(id) FROM seat),
   ```
   
   - This checks if id is less than the maximum id in the table.
   - This prevents an issue when there's an odd number of seats (the last seat remains unchanged).

2. First IF Statement: (Swapping seats for non-last row)
   ```sql
   IF(id % 2 = 0, id - 1, id + 1)
   ```
   - If id is even (id % 2 = 0), swap it with the previous seat (id - 1).
   - If id is odd, swap it with the next seat (id + 1).
   - This effectively swaps adjacent seats.

3. Second IF Statement: (Handling the last seat case)
   ```sql
   IF(id % 2 = 0, id - 1, id)
   ```
   - This only applies when id is the last one in the table (id = MAX(id)).
   - If the last id is even, swap it with the previous (id - 1).
   - If the last id is odd, it stays the same.

4. Final Sorting:
   ```sql
   ORDER BY id
   ```
   - After swapping, the result is sorted back by id so that the seat numbers remain in sequential order.

Example Table:

Original seat Table:
| id | student |
|----|---------|
| 1  | Alice   |
| 2  | Bob     |
| 3  | Charlie |
| 4  | David   |
| 5  | Emma    |

Step-by-Step Execution:
| id | Swapped id | student |
|----|-----------|---------|
| 1  | 2         | Alice   |
| 2  | 1         | Bob     |
| 3  | 4         | Charlie |
| 4  | 3         | David   |
| 5  | 5 (unchanged) | Emma |

Final Output (After ORDER BY id)
| id | student |
|----|---------|
| 1  | Bob     |
| 2  | Alice   |
| 3  | David   |
| 4  | Charlie |
| 5  | Emma    |

---Summary:
- This query swaps adjacent students' seats.
- If there's an odd number of seats, the last student (with the highest id) remains in place.
- The ORDER BY id ensures the output maintains sequential seat numbers.
