1978. Employees Whose Manager Left the Company

Table: Employees

| Column Name | Type     |
|-------------|----------|
| employee_id | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| manager_id  | int      |
| salary      | int      |
In SQL, employee_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the employees, their salary, and the ID of their manager. Some employees do not have a manager (manager_id is null). 
 

Find the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company. When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the Employees table, but the reports still have their manager_id set to the manager that left.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input:  
Employees table:
| employee_id | name      | manager_id | salary |
|-------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| 3           | Mila      | 9          | 60301  |
| 12          | Antonella | null       | 31000  |
| 13          | Emery     | null       | 67084  |
| 1           | Kalel     | 11         | 21241  |
| 9           | Mikaela   | null       | 50937  |
| 11          | Joziah    | 6          | 28485  |

Output: 
| employee_id |
|-------------|
| 11          |

Explanation: 
The employees with a salary less than $30000 are 1 (Kalel) and 11 (Joziah).
Kalel's manager is employee 11, who is still in the company (Joziah).
Joziah's manager is employee 6, who left the company because there is no row for employee 6 as it was deleted.

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT employee_id
FROM Employees a
WHERE salary < 30000 
      AND manager_id IS NOT NULL
      AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 
                      FROM Employees b
                      WHERE b.employee_id = a.manager_id)
ORDER BY employee_id;
```

-- Query Breakdown:
1. FROM Employees a
• This selects from the Employees table and gives it an alias a. So, a refers to each row (employee) in the Employees table.

2. WHERE salary < 30000
• This condition filters employees whose salary is less than 30,000.

3. AND manager_id IS NOT NULL
• This ensures that the employees selected have a manager (i.e., their manager_id is not null).

4. AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Employees b WHERE b.employee_id = a.manager_id)
This is a correlated subquery that checks if the employee’s manager (identified by a.manager_id) is not an existing employee. Specifically:
• SELECT 1 is used because we don’t actually need to return any specific column values—just checking for existence.
• Using SELECT 1 is slightly more efficient than SELECT *, as it makes it clear that we only care about existence, not the data itself. 
• The subquery selects from the Employees table (alias b) and checks if there is any employee (b.employee_id) whose employee_id matches the manager_id of the employee in the outer query (a.manager_id).
• The NOT EXISTS clause returns true if the subquery does not return any rows, meaning that the employee's manager is not an existing employee in the Employees table.
• In other words, this condition filters out employees whose manager is not a valid employee (i.e., no record for a.manager_id exists in the table).

5. ORDER BY employee_id
• This sorts the resulting employee list by their employee_id in ascending order.

Purpose of the Query:
The query selects the employee_id of employees who meet all of the following conditions:

• Their salary is less than 30,000.
• They have a manager (their manager_id is not null).
• Their manager does not exist as an employee in the Employees table (i.e., they have a manager who is not a valid employee).
